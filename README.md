# e-commerce-back-end

## Description
The goal of this challenge was to code the back end of a MYSQL project including the routes for PUT,POST,GET,CREATE,and DELETE. We were to take the starter code and create all of the models, and then create all of the routes neccessary, and be able to demonstrate them within insomnia. The task was relatively easy, it was just a matter of getting everything where it needed to be endpoint wise. I managed to get everything working, and made a video demonstrating every route working within Insomnia.
